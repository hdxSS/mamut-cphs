{"display":"i want to create a simple webapp called Mamut CPHS with Several tabs. This app will be modular so please try using best practices while developing modular apps. The first tab should be called \"Investigaciones\" and should open a form where the user can input the following fields \"Nombre\", \"Edad\", \"Área\", \"Antiguedad\" There should be also be a Long text box with the header \"Declaración de accidente\" On the top there should be an unique ID for the form which auto updates upon saving, i also need to be able able to input the date on a field called \"Date\" this should open a date picker. Finally there should be a Save button called \"Grabar\" When grabar is pressed it should save all the information on a new file in CSV format. Along with saving a new form i should also be able to Consult an older form with a new button called \"Consultar Folio\" Using this button should open a pop up box to search either forUnique ID or \"Nombre\" It should have a way to search not the exact string but if containing it, please think hard on how to achieve this as this will be the basis of the whole app, it needs to be modular, it needs to be saved as an APK that i can run on a simulator or upload to my android 12 compatible phone","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759271077356,"project":"/home/vibecode/workspace"}
{"display":"This is great, let's polish it a bit. I love the UI btw. the input for \"Área\" should be a list picker with the following options:","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759273340568,"project":"/home/vibecode/workspace"}

{"display":"Looks great, but the input field placement for \"Otros\" is a bit missleading as it replaces where \"Antiguedad\" is... can you make it so the Input field appears below the \"Área\" Dropdown picker","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759273872712,"project":"/home/vibecode/workspace"}
{"display":"I'd love for the \"Otros\" text input to actually be on the right of \"Antiguedad\" so it doesn't change the form formatting that much.","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759273972277,"project":"/home/vibecode/workspace"}
{"display":"That's great. Let's add more functionality. Below the \"Declaración de Accidente\" Input box i want to add a new Header called \"Acciones a tomar\" Below this, there should be a checkbox with an input box to enter a corrective measure, on it's right a date input field to set the date of the reminder. The idea is to have a \"+\" button which i can use to add more rows of checkboxes, actions and dates. I want the App to read the date and show a little notification simbol with a dropdown list of reminders when my device date is at least 3 days after the date set for that action. The idea of the Checkbox is to mark the task as finished. All this information has to be saved along the rest of the form data when pressing the \"Grabar\" Button. Also, please use a single CSV file for the whole Database and the unique ID should be 6 digit long started on 000000 and going sequentially upon every new entry. It should not go up when only updating an existing entry","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759274467429,"project":"/home/vibecode/workspace"}

{"display":"Okay, the app is now working correctly. I'm finding odd the reminders are not triggering. They should be triggering if and ID or case is 3 days away or less of the selected date.
