# Icon Generation Instructions

The PWA requires two icon files:
- `/public/icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `/public/icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. They should represent your Mamut CPHS brand.

For a simple approach, you can:
1. Use an online tool like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Create a simple design with "MAMUT CPHS" text on a blue (#2563eb) background
3. Save both sizes in the `/public` directory

The manifest.json is already configured to use these icons.
